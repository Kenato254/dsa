//! This library provides basic implementations of common sorting algorithms and the two-pointer technique for solving various problems.

/// The `sort_algorithms` module offers a collection of sorting functions:
/// * `bubble::sort` - Sorts a slice using the bubble sort algorithm.
/// * `insertion::sort` - Sorts a slice using the insertion sort algorithm.
/// * `selection::sort` - Sorts a slice using the selection sort algorithm.
/// * `two_sum::two_sum` - Finds two numbers in a sorted slice that add up to a given target.

/// The `two_pointer_technique` module provides functions utilizing the two-pointer approach for problem solving.
/// (Specific details about functions in this module can be added as needed based on their implementation)
