/// Bogosort (joke sorting algorithm): 

/// This is not a serious shuffling algorithm but rather a humorous one. 
/// It repeatedly checks if the list is shuffled (in random order) and if not, 
/// completely randomizes it again. While guaranteed to eventually shuffle the list, 
/// it's incredibly inefficient and not a practical solution.
