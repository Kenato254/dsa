/// Fisher-Yates shuffle:

/// This is the most widely used and considered the "gold standard" for shuffling 
/// due to its efficiency and guaranteed randomness. It works by iterating through 
/// the array from the end, selecting a random element from the remaining unsorted 
/// portion and swapping it with the current element.
